abstract = {Magnetization and high-resolution x-ray diffraction measurements of the Kitaev-Heisenberg material alpha-RuCl3 reveal a pressure-induced crystallographic and magnetic phase transition at a hydrostatic pressure of p=0.2 GPa. The structural transition into the triclinic high-pressure Phase is characterized by a very strong dimerization of the Ru-Ru bonds, accompanied by a collapse of the magnetic susceptibility. Ab initio quantum-chemistry calculations disclose a pressure-induced enhancement of the direct 4d-4d bonding on particular Ru-Ru links, causing a sharp increase of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange interactions. These combined experimental and computational data show that the high-pressure nonmagnetic phase of alpha-RuCl3 is a valence bond Crystal formed by strongly bound spin singlets.},

The temperature dependence of the complex dielectric response, including symmetry changes via the phase transition should allow the identification of the microscopic origin of the recorded phonon and spin-orbital excitations. In addition, this type of phase transition seems to be characteristic for a variety of tri-halides crystallizing in a layered honeycomb-type structure and so far is unique, as the low-temperature phase has the higher symmetry. We document a number of highly unusual findings: A characteristic two-step hysteresis of the structural phase transition, accompanied by a dramatic change of the reflectivity. An electronic excitation, which only appears in a narrow temperature range just across the structural phase transition, and a complex dielectric loss spectrum in the THz regime, which could indicate some remnants of Kitaev physics.

The insight that Kitaev physics might be realized in practice has stimulated investigations of candidate materials, recently including alpha-RuCl3. In all the systems studied to date, non-Kitaev interactions induce magnetic order at low temperature. However, in-plane magnetic fields of roughly 8 Tesla suppress the long-range magnetic order in alpha-RuCl3 raising the intriguing possibility of a field-induced QSL exhibiting non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations. Here we present inelastic neutron scattering in alpha-RuCl3 in an applied magnetic field. At a field of 8 Tesla, the spin waves characteristic of the ordered state vanish throughout the Brillouin zone. The remaining single dominant feature of the response is a broad continuum centered at the Gamma point, previously identified as a signature of fractionalized excitations. This provides compelling evidence that a field-induced QSL state has been achieved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. The small gap semiconductor $\alpha$-RuCl 3 has emerged as a promising candidate for quantum spin liquid materials. Thus far, Raman spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and magnetization measurements have provided valuable hints for collective spin behavior in $\alpha$-RuCl 3 bulk crystals. However, the goal of implementing $\alpha$-RuCl 3 into spintronic devices would strongly benefit from the possibility of electrically probing these phenomena. To address this, we first investigated nanoflakes of $\alpha$-RuCl 3 by Raman spectroscopy and observed similar behavior as in the case of the bulk material, including the signatures of possible fractionalized excitations. In complementary experiments, we investigated the electrical charge transport properties of individual $\alpha$-RuCl 3 nanoflakes in the temperature range between 120 and 290 K. The observed temperature-dependent electrical resistivity is consistent with variable range hopping behavior and exhibits a transition at about 180 K, close to the onset temperature observed in our Raman measurements. In conjunction with the established relation between structure and magnetism in the bulk, we interpret this transition to coincide with the emergence of fractionalized excitations due to the Kitaev interactions in the nanoflakes. Compared to the bulk samples, the transition temperature of the underlying structural change is larger in the nanoflakes. This difference is tentatively attributed to the dimensionality of the nanoflakes as well as the formation of stacking faults during mechanical exfoliation. The demonstrated devices open up novel perspectives toward manipulating the Kitaev-phase in $\alpha$-RuCl 3 via electrical means.},

The realization of such a state in actual materials is of significant importance, as it would provide a path to protected states for quantum information and also to Majorana fermions - both very active areas of interest in condensed matter physics. No solid evidence for the existence of such materials has been established in the laboratory, however, despite a decades-long search. Here we report the observation of a quantum spin liquid state in the honeycomb-lattice halide alpha-RuCl3 under a small applied pressure of about 0.7 GPa, after the normally-present antiferromagnetic (AFM) order has been suppressed. Our high-pressure property characterization indicates that the magnetic order melts away smoothly into the QSL state while the AFM transition temperature is still increasing. This leads to a novel phase diagram with the classical critical transition becoming overwhelmed by the quantum critical transition at finite temperature. Further, a surprising dominance of the QSL state is revealed through the insulator-mimicking temperature dependence of the resistivity after the charge gap has been closed near 27 GPa and charge carriers have been introduced to the system. Our results not only establish the existence of a robust QSL state in alpha-RuCl3, but also provide a new strategy for engineering such an exotic state in other materials.},

Several mentions I've seen now that a single magnetic transition below 7K indicates high-quality samples.

Evidence for a QSL is that a spin excitation gap opens up at high parallel magnetic field, which is consistent with a Kitaev QSL.

We follow the evolution of an extended magnetic continuum below the structural phase transition at T s2 ¼ 62 K. With the onset of a long-range magnetic order at T N ¼ 6.5 K, spectral weight is transferred to a well-defined magnetic excitation at ℏ$\omega$ 1 ¼ 2.48 meV, which is accompanied by a higher-energy band at ℏ$\omega$ 2 ¼ 6.48 meV. Both excitations soften in a magnetic field, signaling a quantum phase transition close to B c ¼ 7 T, where a broad continuum dominates the dynamical response. Above B c , the long-range order is suppressed, and on top of the continuum, emergent magnetic excitations evolve. These excitations follow clear selection rules and exhibit distinct field dependencies, characterizing the dynamical properties of a possibly field-induced quantum spin liquid.},

We discuss differences and similarities in the dynamical structure factors of the spin-{\$}1/2{\$} and the classical Kitaev liquids. Interestingly, the low-temperature and low-energy spectrum of the classical model exhibits a finite energy peak, which is the precursor of the one produced by the Majorana modes of the {\$}S=1/2{\$} model. The classical peak is spectrally narrowed compared to the quantum result and can be explained by magnon excitations within fluctuating one-dimensional manifolds (loops). Hence the difference from the classical limit to the quantum limit can be understood by the fractionalization of magnons propagating in one-dimensional manifolds. Moreover, we show that the momentum space distribution of the low-energy spectral weight of the {\$}S=1/2{\$} model follows the momentum space distribution of zero modes of the classical model.},

The compound under investigation passes through a first-order structural phase transition, from a monoclinic high-temperature to a rhombohedral low-temperature phase. The phase transition shows an extreme and unusual hysteretic behavior, which extends from 60 to 166 K. In passing this phase transition, in the complete frequency range investigated we found a significant reflectance change, which amounts almost a factor of two. We provide a broadband spectrum of dielectric constant and dielectric loss from the THz to the mid infrared regime and study in detail the phonon response and the low-lying electronic density of states. We provide evidence for the onset of an optical energy gap, which is of order 200 meV, in good agreement with the gap derived from measurements of the DC electrical resistivity. Remarkably, the onset of the gap exhibits a strong blue shift on increasing temperatures.

abstract = {Recently, $\alpha$-RuCl3 has attracted much attention as a possible material to realize the honeycomb Kitaev model of a quantum-spin-liquid state. Although the magnetic properties of $\alpha$-RuCl3 have been extensively studied, its electronic structure, which is strongly related to its Kitaev physics, is poorly understood. Here, the electronic structure of $\alpha$-RuCl3 was investigated by photoemission (PE) and inverse-photoemission (IPE) spectroscopies. The band gap was directly measured from the PE and IPE spectra and was found to be 1.9 eV, much larger than previously estimated values. Local density approximation (LDA) calculations showed that the on-site Coulomb interaction U could open the band gap without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, the SOC should also be incorporated to reproduce the proper gap size, indicating that the interplay between U and SOC plays an essential role. Several features of the PE and IPE spectra could not be explained by the results of LDA calculations. To explain such discrepancies, we performed configuration-interaction calculations for a RuCl6 3- cluster. The experimental data and calculations demonstrated that the 4d compound $\alpha$-RuCl3 is a Jeff = 1/2 Mott insulator rather than a quasimolecular-orbital insulator. Our study also provides important physical parameters required for verifying the proposed Kitaev physics in $\alpha$-RuCl3. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016.},

The results show that the moment direction is a sensitive probe of the model parameters in real materials.

Analysis of these features allows us to estimate the spin-orbit coupling strength, as well as other parameters describing the local electronic structure, revealing a well-defined hierarchy of energy scales within the Ru d states.

abstract = {Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are topological states of matter exhibiting remarkable properties such as the capacity to protect quantum information from decoherence. Whereas their featureless ground states have precluded their straightforward experimental identification, excited states are more revealing and particularly interesting owing to the emergence of fundamentally new excitations such as Majorana fermions. Ideal probes of these excitations are inelastic neutron scattering experiments. These we report here for a ruthenium-based material, [alpha]-RuCl3, continuing a major search (so far concentrated on iridium materials) for realizations of the celebrated Kitaev honeycomb topological QSL. Our measurements confirm the requisite strong spin-orbit coupling and low-temperature magnetic order matching predictions proximate to the QSL. We find stacking faults, inherent to the highly two-dimensional nature of the material, resolve an outstanding puzzle. Crucially, dynamical response measurements above interlayer energy scales are naturally accounted for in terms of deconfinement physics expected for QSLs. Comparing these with recent dynamical calculations involving gauge flux excitations and Majorana fermions of the pure Kitaev model, we propose the excitation spectrum of [alpha]-RuCl3 as a prime candidate for fractionalized Kitaev physics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society. Single crystals of the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate $\alpha$-RuCl3 have been studied to determine the low-temperature bulk properties, the structure, and the magnetic ground state. Refinements of x-ray diffraction data show that the low-temperature crystal structure is described by space group C2/m with a nearly perfect honeycomb lattice exhibiting less than 0.2{\%} in-plane distortion. The as-grown single crystals exhibit only one sharp magnetic transition at TN=7 K. The magnetic order below this temperature exhibits a propagation vector of k=(0,1,1/3), which coincides with a three-layer stacking of the C2/m unit cells. Magnetic transitions at higher temperatures up to 14 K can be introduced by deformations of the crystal that result in regions in the crystal with a two-layer stacking sequence. The best-fit symmetry-allowed magnetic structure of the as-grown crystals shows that the spins lie in the ac plane, with a zigzag configuration in each honeycomb layer. The three-layer repeat out-of-plane structure can be refined as a 120° spiral order or a collinear structure with a spin direction of 35° away from the a axis. The collinear spin configuration yields a slightly better fit and also is physically preferred. The average ordered moment in either structure is less than 0.45(5) $\mu$B per Ru3+ ion.},

Our neutron diffraction study of single crystal samples confirms that the low temperature peak in the specific heat is associated with a magnetic order with unit cell doubling along the honeycomb (100) direction, which is consistent with zigzag order, one of the types of magnetic order predicted within the framework of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model.},

abstract = {Intensive studies of the interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and electronic correlations in transition-metal compounds have recently been undertaken. In particular, j eff = 1/2 bands on a honeycomb lattice provide a pathway to realize Kitaev's exactly solvable spin model. However, since current wisdom requires strong atomic SOC to make j eff = 1/2 bands, studies have been limited to iridium oxides. Contrary to this expectation, we demonstrate how Kitaev interactions arise in 4d-orbital honeycomb $\alpha$-RuCl 3 , despite having significantly weaker SOC than the iridium oxides, via assistance from electron correlations. A strong-coupling spin model for these correlation-assisted j eff = 1/2 bands is derived, in which large antiferromagnetic Kitaev interactions emerge along with ferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions. Our analyses suggest that the ground state is a zigzag-ordered phase lying close to the antiferromagnetic Kitaev spin liquid. Experimental implications for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and optical conductivities are discussed. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.91.241110 PACS number(s): 71.70.Ej, 75.10.Jm, 71.20.Be, 75.30.Et Introduction. Elucidating the cornucopia of novel physical phenomena exhibited by transition-metal compounds with electrons occupying d orbitals has been a key focus of modern condensed matter physics. Relativistic effects such as spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which entangles the spin and orbital degrees of freedom, were largely ignored until recently when it was realized that these effects in cohort with electronic correlations could give rise to new ground states, including those with uncommon magnetic ordering [1–8]. In particular, these effects bring about anisotropic exchange interactions that have been suggested as a way to engineer the exactly solvable Kitaev spin model [9] in the honeycomb iridate Na 2 IrO 3 . These anisotropic interactions arise between two neighboring iridium (Ir) sites, each with a single j eff = 1/2 state, through superexchange mediated by the p orbitals on the intervening oxygen atoms that make up the edge-sharing octahedra around each Ir atom [10,11]. This j eff = 1/2 state, composed of an equal mixture of t 2g orbitals, manifests at large SOC $\lambda$L {\textperiodcentered} S, where $\lambda$ denotes the coupling strength, and S and L are spin and orbital angular momentum operators of the t 2g orbitals, respectively. SOC is a relativistic effect roughly proportional to Z 4 , where Z is the atomic number, and hence studies so far have been limited to iridium (Z = 77) and other heavy elements. Na 2 IrO 3 and Li 2 IrO 3 , while good candidates, suffer from trigonal lattice distortions and diminished two dimensionality (2D) due to the Na atoms sandwiched between the honeycomb layers. The correct low-energy description is also under debate: single SOC-induced j eff = 1/2 state versus nonrelativistic molecular orbitals [12,13]. Thus, the search for more ideal 2D honeycomb materials described by a j eff = 1/2 picture is important. Recently, it was suggested that a ruthenium chloride $\alpha$-RuCl 3 (RuCl 3) is a good candidate because of its more ideal 2D honeycomb structure [14]. Although RuCl 3 should be metallic given the partially filled bands from the five * hykee@physics.utoronto.ca},

abstract = {Finite-temperature ({\$}T{\$}) properties of a Kitaev model defined on a honeycomb lattice are investigated by a quantum Monte Carlo simulation, from the viewpoint of fractionalization of quantum {\$}S=1/2{\$} spins into two types of Majorana fermions, itinerant and localized. In this system, the entropy is released successively at two well-separated {\$}T{\$} scales, as a clear indication of the thermal fractionalization. We show that the high-{\$}T{\$} crossover, which is driven by itinerant Majorana fermions, is closely related with the development of nearest-neighbor spin correlations. On the other hand, the low-{\$}T{\$} crossover originates in thermal fluctuations of fluxes composed of localized Majorana fermions, by which the spectrum of itinerant Majorana fermions is significantly disturbed. As a consequence, in the intermediate-{\$}T{\$} range between the two crossovers, the system exhibits {\$}T{\$}-linear behavior in the specific heat and coherent transport of Majorana fermions, which are unexpected for the Dirac semimetallic spectrum in the low-{\$}T{\$} limit. We also show that the flux fluctuations tend to open an energy gap in the Majorana spectrum near the gapless-gapped phase boundary. Our results indicate that the fractionalization is experimentally observable in the specific heat, spin correlations, and transport properties.},

In particular, our measurements reveal unusual magnetic scattering, typified by a broad continuum. The temperature dependence of this continuum is evident over a large scale compared to the magnetic ordering temperature, suggestive of frustrated magnetic interactions. This is confirmed through an analysis of the phonon linewidths, which show a related anomaly due to spin-phonon coupling. These observations are in line with theoretical expectations for the Heisenberg-Kitaev model and suggest that $\alpha$−RuCl3 may be close to a quantum spin liquid ground state.},

LiZn 2 Mo 3 O 8  is an electrically insulating geometrically frustrated antiferromagnet in which inorganic Mo 3 O 13  clusters each behaves as a single S = 1/2 unit, with the clusters arranged on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. Prior results have shown that LiZn 2 Mo 3 O 8  does not exhibit static magnetic order down to at least T = 0.05 K, and instead possesses a valence bond ground state. Here, we show that LiZn 2 Mo 3 O 8  can be hole doped by oxidation with I 2  and subsequent removal of Zn 2+  cations to access the entire range of electron count, from one to zero unpaired electrons per site on the triangular lattice. Contrary to expectations, no metallic state is induced; instead, the primary effect is to suppress the number of sites contributing to the condensed valence-bond state. Further, diffraction and pair-distribution function analysis show no evidence for local Jahn-Teller distortions or other deviations from the parent trigonal symmetry as a function of doping or temperature. Taken together, the data and density functional theory calculations indicate that removal of electrons from the magnetic layers favors Anderson localization of the resulting hole and an increase in the electrical band-gap over the formation of a metallic and superconducting state. These results put strong constraints on the chemical conditions necessary to realize metallic states from parent insulating geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets.},
