\section*{Executive Summary}
Quantum Spin Liquids (QSLs) are magnetic states of matter characterized by massive ground state entanglement without long-range magnetic order, even at $T = 0$ K. These materials host exotic quasiparticle excitations (e.g., Majorana fermions) and, upon doping, may demonstrate unconventional superconductivity. Previous attempts to dope the Mott insulator and Kitaev spin liquid $\alpha$-ruthenium trichloride (a 2D van der Waals material) have either disordered the lattice, added only a small number of carriers, or both. To prevent these issues, I have investigated doping $\alpha$-ruthenium trichloride using electrolyte gating with in-situ transport, Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. I have found that the cations in the electrolyte readily intercalate between the layers, despite their large size. When controlling for the intercalation, I have not observed any electronic phase transition within the limits of electrolyte gating - in fact, resistivity either remains the same or increases. In this dissertation, I propose to show that at large hole doping without lattice disorder, $\alpha$-ruthenium trichloride does not undergo an electronic phase transition and only becomes more resistive, contrary to typical Mott insulators and the predictions for quantum spin liquids. This result suggests that the electronic structure of $\alpha$-ruthenium trichloride requires more investigation and that the material is not suitable for investigating doped spin liquid physics.


\section{Objectives}
Measure the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Raman spectra of $\alpha$-ruthenium trichloride (hereafter \rucl) under ambient conditions as a function of doping by electrolyte gating (complete).
	\item Transport properties of \rucl as a function of doping by electrolyte gating (in progress).
	\item Interlayer separation as a function of doping by electrolyte gating using x-ray diffraction (in progress)
\end{itemize}
To conclude one of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Observe an electronic phase transition in \rucl as a function of doping.
	\item Do not observe an electronic phase transition in \rucl as a function of doping and identify lattice distortions from Raman spectroscopy or XRD that disturb Kitaev interactions.
	\item Do not observe an electronic phase transition or lattice distortions as a function of doping, and rule out the presence of either below a particular charge density.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Motivation}
Quantum Spin Liquids (QSLs) are ground states of magnetic systems showing massive entanglement and correlation between spins without associated long-range magnetic order or spontaneous symmetry breaking, even at $T = 0$ K. 

QSLs have attracted research attention as these states host fractionalized excitations with nonabelian statistics \cite{Balents2010} which are relevant to quantum computation. QSLs may also be related to an unconventional form of superconductivity originally proposed by Anderson \cite{Lee2008}. $\alpha$-ruthenium trichloride (hereafter RuCl\textsubscript{3}), a Mott insulator, is a leading candidate material for having a ground state described as a Kitaev QSL, an exactly solvable quantum spin liquid state arising from anisotropic exchange interactions on a honeycomb lattice \cite{Kitaev2006}.

Adding charge to Mott insulators has resulted in exotic states, most notably high-temperature superconductors. Further, the connection between \rucl and fractionalized excitations makes it an exciting material to study the effect of doping. I therefore propose investigating \rucl using electrolyte gating, transport, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. I have selected these tools to add charge to the material while simultaneously characterizing the electronic phase (transport) and changes to the lattice (Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction).

\section{Literature Review}
Measurements of \rucl are consistent with it being a 2D material \cite{Kim2015a} and a spin-assisted Mott insulator \cite{Plumb2014}, with either thermally-activated band conduction and electron charge carriers \cite{Rojas1983}, or variable range hopping conduction \cite{Mashhadi2018}. Measurements of the band gap in \rucl fall into two broad categories. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and thermal activation of conductivity suggest a value for $E_{G}$ between of around 0.2 eV \cite{Binotto1971,Rojas1983,Ziatdinov2016}. Other measurements report larger gaps, including electron spectroscopy (between 1.2 eV and 1.9 eV \cite{Koitzsch2016,Zhou2016,Sinn2016}), and optical methods (between 0.2 eV and 1.2 eV \cite{Reschke2017,Pollini1996,Sandilands2016}). Calculations expect a gap between 0.05 eV and 1 eV  \cite{Sarikurt2017,Kim2015}.

Magnetically, \rucl is a paramagnet above its N{\'e}el temperature of 7 K; below 7 K it orders in an antiferromagnetic zigzag phase \cite{Sears2015}. Magnetic excitations above the N{\'e}el temperature, as observed by neutron scattering and raman scattering \cite{Banerjee2016,Sandilands2015}, are consistent with predictions for a Kitaev QSL, suggesting that \rucl is a proximate spin liquid.

\rucl displays several phase transitions. At approximately 150K, \rucl  undergoes a hysteretic phase transition from a rhombohedral to a monoclinic crystal structure \cite{Kubota2015,Ziatdinov2016,Glamazda2017,Reschke2017}. In addition to the N{\'e}el ordering at 7 K, another magnetic transition occurs at 14 K in some samples due to stacking faults \cite{Banerjee2016}. Under application of an in-plane magnetic field greater than $H_{c} \approx 7$ T, the antiferromagnetic phase is suppressed and the ground state becomes a field-induced disordered state. \cite{Hentrich2017,Wolter2017,Banerjee2017,Wang2017,Baek2017}. Measurements of the excitations of this disordered state by neutron scattering, microwave absorption, and thermal conductivity suggest this state is a field-induced quantum spin liquid \cite{Banerjee2016,Wellm2017,Kasahara2018}. Recently, a novel type of field-induced spin liquid state in \rucl was identified \cite{Lampen-Kelley2018}.

Raman studies of bulk and exfoliated \rucl show a spectrum that is thickness independent above ~40 nm, with several characteristic peaks below 500 cm$^{-1}$. For samples thinner than 10 nm, the three Raman peaks near 300 cm$^{-1}$ begin to merge. The presence of a broad background signal at low Raman shifts has been interpreted as phonon coupling to magnetic excitations of the proximate spin liquid state \cite{Zhou2018,Du2019}.

When exposed to ions in solution, cations easily intercalate between the van der Waals layers where two chlorine planes meet. Applying an electric potential to \rucl in an ion-containing solution can reversibly drive cations in and out of the spaces between layers. For intercalated \rucl, X-ray diffraction measurements show the increase in interlayer separation is consistent with the size of the intercalated ion \cite{Steffen1986,Schollhorn1983}.

There have been several previous attempts to dope \rucl and other QSL materials and candidates. Zhou did not observe a phase transition when doping \rucl by intercalation of charge donors or evaporating them onto the surface of bulk \rucl \cite{Zhou2016}. For similarly-intercalated \ruclnospace , Koitzsch did not observe a phase transition but instead posited that the intercalation caused charge ordering that blocked nearest-neighbor Kitaev interactions \cite{Koitzsch2017a}. However, the absence of a phase transition in these measurements may be due to insufficient surface doping (for Zhou's measurement) or lattice distortions caused by intercalation (for both Zhou and Koitzsch). Efforts to chemically dope Herbertsmithite \cite{Kelly2016} and the QSL candidate LiZn$_{2-x}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ \cite{Sheckelton2015} also did not show any phase transitions, though again lattice distortions cannot be ruled out. Notably, first principles density functional calculations suggest electrons added to a Kagome lattice-type quantum spin liquid will become localized due to lattice distortions \cite{Liu2018}.


\section{Research and Methodology}

A review of the literature suggests that \rucl does not undergo an electronic phase transition upon doping. However, previous attempts to dope \rucl have not approached the charge density possible with electrolyte gating, or have involved a technique that necessarily disorders the lattice. These lattice distortions may affect the Kitaev interactions that make \rucl a QSL, and therefore prevent investigation of properties related to QSLs.

Electrolyte gating provides an opportunity to heavily dope \rucl without disordering the lattice. Therefore, measuring transport with electrolyte gating allows characterizing the electronic phase as a function of doping independent of the disorder inherent in other methods. Raman spectroscopy and XRD can be used to verify that electrolyte gating does not introduce disorder to the lattice.

DFT calculations by Liu suggest that doped \rucl does not undergo a phase transition because the added charge localizes by forming polarons bound to lattice sites \cite{Liu2018}. Specifically, electrostatic interactions cause the lattice around an added charge carrier to relax, creating a local potential well that immobilizes the charge carrier. This lattice relaxation is predicted to cause changes in bond lengths, which should result in changes in the Raman spectrum (I would expect peak broadening and/or a shift in peak position). Further, measurements by Koitzsch suggest that charge doping may be correlated with lattice distortions that block Kitaev interactions \cite{Koitzsch2017a}.

I propose drawing one of the following conclusions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Observe an electronic phase transition in \rucl as a function of doping.
	\item Do not observe an electronic phase transition in \rucl as a function of doping and identify lattice distortions from Raman spectroscopy or XRD that disturb Kitaev interactions.
	\item Do not observe an electronic phase transition or lattice distortions as a function of doping, and rule out the presence of either below a particular charge density.
\end{enumerate}
	

\subsection{Doping Method}

Electrolyte gating uses an electrically polarized molten salt to induce a high charge density at the surface of a material of interest. The potential at the surface is proportional to the ratio of the ion charge to the size of the anion or cation. Because the anion and cation size is $\mathcal{O}$(1 nm), the electric field at the interface is high enough to induce charge densities of $\mathcal{O}$(10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$). Ionic liquid gating has been used to demonstrate phase transitions and investigate the structure of other 2D materials\cite{Braga2012,Ueno2008}.

I will measure the charge density by either (1) integrating the current applied to the ionic liquid and measuring the area visually or (2) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Hall measurements on \ruclnospace, which is highly insulating, have been challenging.

\subsection{Raman Measurements}

I will measure the Raman spectra of exfoliated \rucl samples through an electrolyte. Raman measurements will be made on the Horiba Labram in SNC under ambient (room temperature, 1 atm) conditions on devices fabricated for this particular purpose. Raan peaks shifting, broadening, or disappearing could indicate lattice distortions or phase changes. I have confirmed that the Raman spectra of bulk and exfoliated \rucl are similar at thicknesses greater than 10 nm (Figure 4), as previously identified in the literature.

  \captionsetup{width=0.5\textwidth}
  \captionof{figure}{Raman spectra for exfoliated and bulk \ruclnospace, offset for clarity}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Transport Measurements}

I will measure thermal activation energies extracted from resistance-temperature curves of \rucl at fixed ionic liquid voltages in a DGG group cryostat. Phase changes could include a metal-insulator transition (identified by a change in sign of $\frac{d\rho}{dt}$), or an abrupt change in functional form or activation energy of $\rho(T)$.

\subsection{X-ray Measurements}

I will measure the diffraction pattern of pristine and electrolyte gated \rucl as a function of electrolyte gate voltage in the Stanford XRD lab. Changes to the interlayer separation or broadening of the associated peak could indicate latttice disorder or a phase change.

\subsection{Transport}

Samples with thicknesses from bulk to tens of nanometers measured in the DGG lab (Figure 1) were found to have resistivity and thermal activation energies approximately consistent with the literature \cite{Rojas1983}. Direct electrolyte gating with DEME-TFSI showed only minor changes in resistivity and thermal activation energy. When the surface of \rucl is protected by a thin layer of hexagonal boron nitride and an ionic liquid gate (DEME-TFSI) is applied (Figure 2), I continued to find simply activated conduction and small variations in room temperature resistance and thermal activation energy.

Subsequent measurements in the DGG lab show that in unbiased \rucl exposed to electrolyte for an extended period (i.e., hours), cations intercalate between the layers and cannot be removed even with a subsequent bias up to the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte. Because the measurements discussed in the previous paragraph were made after pumping overnight to remove water, these samples were most likely fully intercalated independent of applied bias, and therefore not representative of an unperturbed lattice. More recent measurements, in which the bias is applied during pumpdown such that the material is not intercalated, suggest that the material is more resistive than pristine \ruclnospace. Quantitative data for these measurements is forthcoming.

A thin (3 nm) sample of \rucl displayed variable range hopping rather than simply activated conduction (Figure 3), with a thermal activation energy in the high temperature limit of 53 meV, consistent with previously published work for thin flakes of \rucl \cite{Mashhadi2018}. Applying an ionic liquid gate to this thin sample made only small changes to its properties. This is the only sample I have measured (one of ten) that shows variable range hopping.

\subsection{Raman Spectroscopy}

\rucl has seven Raman spectroscopy peaks; six of these are intralayer vibrational modes consistent with the symmetries of the \rucl lattice. The seventh does not have an associated symmetry but may be associated with an interlayer vibration \cite{Zhou2018}. Raman spectra of bulk and exfoliated ruthenium chloride measured by the DGG group are consistent with that reported in literature.

When exposed to electrolyte under ambient conditions, cations readily intercalate between van der Waals layers and dramatically change the Raman spectrum of the material. Peaks near 300 cm$^{-1}$ are broadened into a single diffuse peak, and the peak near 150 cm$^{-1}$ disappears. Applying a large negative gate voltage to the eletrolyte reverses this intercalation by driving the cations from the lattice and returns the raman spectrum to its previous, non-intercalated state. For \rucl under electrolyte biased at large negative voltage such that cations are not intercalated, the Raman peak positions and peak widths are identical to pristine \rucl within a Raman shift of less than 1 cm$^{-1}$. Because the Raman spectra of \rucl with electrolyte gating and negative bias is identical to pristine \ruclnospace , there is minimal distortion in single layers of \rucl despite the presence of the electrolyte.

\end{figure}

\subsection{X-ray diffraction}

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show \rucl has an interlayer separation of about 5.6 \r{A} \cite{Schollhorn1983}. This interlayer separation shows up clearly in XRD measurements as a sharp peak near $2\theta = $ 15\degree, which I have observed here at Stanford.

  \captionof{figure}{X-ray diffractogram for pristine exfoliated \rucl measured at Stanford}
\end{figure}

\section{Remaining Measurements}

\subsection{Transport Measurements}

Previous measurements were most likely intercalated, regardless of applied gate voltage. Accordingly, I will redo these measurements by biasing the electrolyte at large negative gate voltage and verifying the removal of the ions from the lattice before allowing the sample to pump down.

A collaborator has provided a Polymer Ionic Liquid (PIL), a new type of electrolyte with a sterically hindered cation that should not intercalate. I will also measure transport using a PIL to investigate electron doping without lattice disorder.

\subsection{X-ray Measurements}

I will measure X-ray diffraction patterns for electrolyte-gated \rucl as a function of gate voltage. I will confirm that the cations intercalate and that at large negative gate voltage the interlayer spacing returns to its pristine value.

\section{Risks}

\subsection{Electrochemistry}

Electrochemistry between the electrolyte, ohmic contacts, and \rucl could confuse the measured or calculated carrier density induced in the \ruclnospace. To minimize any electrochemical effects, I will dry the electrolyte prior to use, use only materials known not to react with the electrolyte, and carefully monitor the leakage current during measurement.

\subsection{Large Raman Background}

The electrolyte may have features in its Raman spectra that could obscure localization features. Accordingly, I have identified an ionic liquid (DEME-BF4) with no Raman features in the region of interest. To further reduce the impact of an ionic liquid Raman background, I will use the thinnest layer of ionic liquid possible and minimize the noise by taking multiple spectra.

\subsection{X-ray measurements}

X-ray measurements may show that the interlayer spacing does not return to its original value after the ions are removed from the interlayer spaces (the peak may correspond to a different interlayer separation or be broadened - indicated a range of interlayer separations). I think this is unlikely, given previous measurements on this material. However, all Kitaev interactions are present in a single layer of \ruclnospace , and the disorder in a single layer should be captured by Raman spectroscopy, which does not show any peak shifts or broadening. Therefore, I will include the change or disorder in interlayer spacing as a potential cause for the absence of a transition, which is a novel conclusion. 

\subsubsection{Fabrication}

The notional fabrication process will be:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Exfoliate \rucl using scotch tape onto 300 nm SiO\textsubscript{2} on Si chips using O\textsubscript{2} plasma and heat
	\item Select and characterize flakes using optical and atomic force microscopy
	\item Write and develop bond pads and ohmic contact pattern via electron beam or optical lithography
	\item Argon milling to reduce contact resistance
	\item Evaporate Ti/Au contacts
	\item Liftoff in Acetone
	\item Wirebond and apply ionic liquid
\end{itemize}

\section{Timeframe}
I plan to graduate in September 2019. A notional schedule follows.

\begin{itemize}
	\item May 2019: Finish remaining measurements
	\item June - July 2019: Writing and defense preparation
	\item Week of 22 July 2019: Dissertation defense
	\item 26 September 2019: Degree conferred	
\end{itemize}
